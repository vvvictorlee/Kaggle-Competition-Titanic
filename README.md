# Kaggle-Competition-Titanic

This is a project in an IPython Notebook for the Kaggle competition, Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster. The goal of this repository is to implement classic machine learning algorithms from scratch and also to provide a comparative analysis using SciKit-Learn for the people who are interested in machine learning.

* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [IPython](http://ipython.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [SciKit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)


###   Kaggle Competition | Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Because there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew, some groups of people might be more likely to survive than the others. In this project, we want to investigate the factors that lead to the survival of people. We would apply several tools of data mining algorithms to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. The result of our predictions can become a good source to improve the survival rate of passengers and crew.

####  The components of the project contains the following steps:
####  Data Handling
*   Importing Data with Pandas
*   Extracting new features
*   Handling missing values 
*   Transforming attributes into ordinal type
*   Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

####  Machine Learning Algorithms Implementations from scratch
*   Implementing algorithms including 
      - Naive Bayers
      - Decision Tree
      - Perceptron
      - K-means and K-modes with KNN 
*   Compare results using accuracy

####  Data Analysis using SciKit-Learn
*    Supervised Machine learning Techniques:
      - Random Forest 
      - Decison Tree
      - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
      - KNN
      - Naive Bayers (both Gaussian and Multinominal)
      - Perceptron
      - SGD
      - Logistic Regression

####  Valuation of the Analysis
*   K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
*   Output the results from the IPython Notebook to Kaggle
